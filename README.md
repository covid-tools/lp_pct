Personal containment tents are proposed as a low cost solution to patient isolation.

FR1. The basic design is to use tarpaulin containment structure of the size of an isolation ward bed, with room for at least one healthcare personnel to be accomodated inside.

FR2. The containment should allow negative pressure gradient to be maintained vis a vis surrounding

FR3. The outlet vent should pass through an appropriate mechanism to ensure containment of contagion

FR4. The ingress and egress of healthcare personnel must not result in break in containment

FR5. The entire structure must be energy efficient and utilise natural ligthing as much as possible

Proposed possible solution

1. Tarpaulin lent with 2 stage ingress / egress stage

2. Negative pressure gradient created with high cfm exhaust fans
